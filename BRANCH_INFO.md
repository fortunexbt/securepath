# üå≥ Branch Information

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Successfully created refactoring branch**: `refactor/modular-architecture`

### What We Did:

1. **Created safe testing branch** - All refactoring work is isolated from production
2. **Cleaned up directory structure**:
   - Moved test files to `testing_files/` directory
   - Renamed `settings_simple.py` ‚Üí `settings.py`
   - Renamed `models_simple.py` ‚Üí `models.py`
   - Removed Python cache files
   - Updated all imports accordingly

3. **Updated `.gitignore`** for the refactoring branch to allow new files
4. **Committed all refactored code** with comprehensive commit message

### Branch Structure:

```
main (production) ‚Üê YOU ARE SAFE, NOTHING CHANGED HERE
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ refactor/modular-architecture ‚Üê ALL NEW CODE IS HERE
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

### To push to GitHub for testing:
```bash
# Push the refactoring branch to GitHub
git push -u origin refactor/modular-architecture
```

### To test locally:
```bash
# Make sure you're on the refactor branch
git checkout refactor/modular-architecture

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the refactored bot
python main_new.py
```

### To switch between branches:
```bash
# Use the helper script
./switch_branch.sh main     # Go to production
./switch_branch.sh refactor  # Go to refactoring branch

# Or use git directly
git checkout main                        # Production
git checkout refactor/modular-architecture  # Refactoring
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT SAFETY NOTES

1. **The `main` branch is UNTOUCHED** - Your production bot is safe
2. **All refactoring is isolated** in `refactor/modular-architecture`
3. **Original files remain unchanged** - `main.py`, `config.py`, `database.py` are intact on main
4. **Different `.gitignore` files** - Each branch has appropriate ignore rules

## üìã Testing Checklist

Before merging to main:
- [ ] Test all Discord commands locally
- [ ] Verify database connections work
- [ ] Check all API integrations (OpenAI, Perplexity)
- [ ] Validate configuration loading from .env
- [ ] Run performance comparisons
- [ ] Get team review on GitHub PR
- [ ] Test in staging environment
